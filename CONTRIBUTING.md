# How to register a plugin project in the catalogue?

The registration process is executed via GitHub [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

These are the typical steps of such a process:

1. Select the appropriate category for your plugin project.
2. Look if in the selected category table exists an entry for such 
plugin(s) e.g. Tango entry in the Software category table.
    * If there is already an entry, add your plugin project as a next row
    * If there is no entry, create a new row respecting the alphabetical order 
    within the category table.
3. In the row, fill the following information: name, description, link(s) to 
project(s)
4. Create a PR with the changes explained in the point 3.

Note: In order to facilitate browsing of the _System_ category it is splitted in sub-tables per facility.
Please add your project to an already existing facility sub-table, or create a new one for your facility.
