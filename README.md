# Catalogue of third-party Sardana plugins

The aim of this catalogue is to facilitate the Sardana users and
developers access to the Sardana plugins. The idea of creating such a
catalogue came from the [SEP16](https://github.com/reszelaz/sardana/blob/sep16/doc/source/sep/SEP16.md).

**IMPORTANT**: The Sardana plugins projects are currently being moved from the old repositories:
[macros](https://sourceforge.net/p/sardana/macros.git/ci/master/tree/) and
[controllers](https://sourceforge.net/p/sardana/controllers.git/ci/master/tree/).
If you don't find a plugin here, take a look also at the old repos. Sorry about the inconveniences!

It is the whole Sardana Community responsibility to keep it up-to-date. So 
if you develop a Sardana plugin, please consult the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide on
how to register your plugin here.

This catalogue groups plugins in the categories:

* [Hardware](hardware.md)
* [Instrument](instrument.md)
* [System](system.md)
* [Software](software.md)
* [Other](other.md)

In order to find a plugin that you need simply browse the above
categories or use the GitHub search within this repository for a keyword.

If you would like to be notified when new plugins get registered in the
catalogue just subscribe to this repository notifications.
