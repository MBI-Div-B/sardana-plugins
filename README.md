# Catalogue of third-party Sardana plugins

The aim of this catalogue is to facilitate the Sardana users and
developers access to the Sardana plugins. The idea of creating such a
catalogue came from the [SEP16](https://github.com/reszelaz/sardana/blob/sep16/doc/source/sep/SEP16.md).

It is the whole Sardana Community responsibility to keep it up-to-date. So 
if you develop a Sardana plugin, please consult the CONTRIBUTING.md guide on
how to register your plugin here.

This catalogue groups plugins in the categories:

* [Hardware](hardware.md)
* [Instrument](instrument.md)
* [System](system.md)
* [Software](software.md)
* [Other](other.md)

In order to find a plugin that you need ou can either browse the above
categories or use the GitHub search within this repository for a keyword.

If you would like to be notified when new plugins get registered in the
catalogue just subscribe to this repository notifications.
